**Sync Dash** is a hyper-casual mobile game prototype built in Unity. It showcases a clever implementation of real-time state synchronization by simulating multiplayer locally â€” no servers required. The screen is divided into two halves:

- **Right Side** â†’ Player controls a glowing cube that auto-runs and jumps over obstacles.
- **Left Side** â†’ A ghost cube mirrors the playerâ€™s actions in real-time with optional delay and interpolation, mimicking network syncing behavior.
